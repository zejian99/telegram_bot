# Telegram Task Reminder Bot

I created this Telegram bot as a cute little project to help remind my partner and me of the daily tasks that we need to finish. Yes, you may wonder why I can't just use the calendar app? Well, I wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about bot development and enhance my programming skills.

## Features

- **Custom Reminders**: Set personalized reminders with endearing messages.
- **Task Categorization**: Organize tasks based on our preferences.
- **Playful Responses**: Receive fun and engaging responses from the bot.

## Motivation

During this project, I was able to delve into different aspects of coding, including:

- Setting up the bot on Telegram
- Handling API calls
- Managing user interactions

It was a fun and challenging experience that allowed me to experiment with new techniques and improve my problem-solving abilities.

## Personalization

Creating this bot allowed me to add personalized elements that a regular calendar app might lack. For instance, I included features such as custom reminders with endearing messages, task categorization based on our preferences, and even some playful responses to make our task management more enjoyable.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project not only helps us stay organized but also brings a touch of personalization and creativity into our daily routines. It's a small but meaningful way to combine learning with practicality and add a bit of fun to our task management.
